# ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement â€“ E-Commerce Sales Analysis

## ðŸ§© Business Challenge

An e-commerce company operating across various Indian states lacked visibility into its regional and categorical sales performance. As a result, it faced difficulties in optimizing its inventory, understanding customer preferences, tracking profitability trends, and enhancing customer experience through informed business strategies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This analysis was conducted to:

- Identify the **top-performing states and cities** by total revenue.
- Highlight the most profitable **product sub-categories**.
- Analyze **monthly and quarterly sales trends** to understand seasonality and performance dips.
- Evaluate **customer behavior**, including purchase quantity by individual customers.
- Explore **payment mode preferences** (e.g., COD, UPI, Debit/Credit Cards) to enhance checkout and delivery models.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome

The outcome is a Power BI dashboard that offers:

- KPIs such as Total Revenue, Profit, Quantity Sold, and Average Order Value (AOV).
- Interactive visuals: bar charts, pie charts, and a geographic map of orders by city.
- Filters by quarter and state for dynamic decision-making.
- Clear insights to support strategic planning, category-level promotions, and efficient logistics.
